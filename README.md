3. Binary Search in Python

Project to demonstrate how the binary search works to find a given number inside a list.
It returns the steps taken and how many times a list is split in half to be able to find the given number on it.

Examples:

In a given list: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

To find the number 1 - List needs to be split in half twice:

To find the number 8 - List needs to be split in half once:
